# Ordinary Differential Equation Solvers
The following repo shows different numerical methods to solve ODEs, with some basic mathematical explanations.

It takes inspiration from the information provided in the _Advanced Analysis and Optimization - Module 1_ course I attended in my second year of university.

It is not meant as a replacement for that material, nor as a thorough guide in numerical analysis. I leave that task to the professors :)

## Notes

The code is in a Jupyter Notebook, so it is *static*, but I'm trying to build a web app on this. If you happen to have experience in the field of web development and want to expand your portfolio of projects *do not hesitate to contact me*!
