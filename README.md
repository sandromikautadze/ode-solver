# Ordinary Differential Equation Solvers

### Introduction
The following repo shows different numerical methods to solve ODEs, with some basic mathematical explanations and interesting applications. At the time of writing, the only method is that of Euler; new ones will be added as *life goes on*. 

The material takes inspiration from the information provided in the _Advanced Analysis and Optimization - Module 1_ course I attended in my second year of university. It is not meant as a replacement for that material, nor as a thorough guide in numerical analysis.

### Repo Structure
* **methods** contains the "theory" behind each method with examples to illustrate the math behind it
* **applications** contains interesting applications of the presented methods

### PS

The codes are in a Jupyter Notebook, so they are *static*, but I'm trying to build a web app on this! If you happen to have experience in the field of web development (or similar) and want to expand your portfolio of projects **do not hesitate to contact me!**
