# Ordinary Differential Equation Solvers
The following repo shows different numerical methods to solve ODEs, with some basic mathematical explanations. At the time of writing, the only method is that of Euler; new ones will be added as *life goes on*. 

The material takes inspiration from the information provided in the _Advanced Analysis and Optimization - Module 1_ course I attended in my second year of university. It is not meant as a replacement for that material, nor as a thorough guide in numerical analysis.

### Notes

The code is in a Jupyter Notebook, so it is *static*, but I'm trying to build a web app on this. If you happen to have experience in the field of web development (or similar) and want to expand your portfolio of projects **do not hesitate to contact me!**
